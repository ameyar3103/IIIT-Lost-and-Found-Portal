# LFS ONLINE

This is a product that aims to serve IIIT-H students in order to make tracking of lost and found items decentralized and easier. This product also deals with buying, selling and borrowing items within the campus to make these processes decentralised, efficient and easier for all present in the campus.
We have used tools like HTML,CSS, Javascript and Flask in order to make this product.
First one has to run the server.py code that is basically the flask functionality of our software.Then on running the code it generates an ip address, which takes us to the login page of the website.
The user can then enter their credentials and login into the website. In case if the user is new then we have also provided a link for the user to register themselves to that particular website.
After login the user lands on the main page where we have various functionalities:-
1. The user can submit lost item under the lost section of the navbar. Another link is provided in the description of the home page.
2. The user can report a found item under the found section. A link for the same has been provided in the description of the home page.
3. The user can sell an item by filling the sell form, giving all the necessary details.
4. We have provided the user with a all posts page and the user can easily navigate through the page with the help of an efficient filter option. Users can    borrow and buy items using this page. We give the details of the seller so that buyer, if having certain queries about the product and its price, can      connect with th seller and have it resolved 
5. We have provided an about us page whose link is present in the footer of the website.
6. The user also has access to a user profile page where the user can track their activity in the website.
7. We have also provided with a logout page which when clicked logs the user out of the website and takes the user back to the login page.

Enjoy using our software!
